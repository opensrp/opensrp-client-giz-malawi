OpenSRP android case management client implementation for Malawi
## Project Title 
The Malawi eRegister Project is an initiative to digitize the recording of health related encounters in Malawi. The main objectives are to streamline workflows by digitally tracking clients and their current health status. The approach is to have an application running on mobile android tablets, which are then used by health workers to capture and analyze information while providing health care services.This covers the main aspects of Child Health, Antenatal care, Maternity, Postnatal care, Outpatient and reporting. The reporting is connected to a DHIS2 instance hence the health workers are able to automatically send out monthly reports to the national government.
